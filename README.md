# Description
Our application is designed to make it easy to establish meeting dates and times with friends, organizations, or groups. Being able to add and view others' public calendars allows for easy display of when you are available. 

If you and a few others want to find an overlapping time to meet, we will include a tool/sub-group (more on this later) feature that aligns and suggests people's available times. The creator of this group can then mark the time and automatically submit it to each person's calendar (showcasing the auto updates). 

Lastly, there is another layer of a group that can house the aforementioned "sub-groups". These can be organizations that house larger mainboard calendars that showcase to others a list of different times or events to those within it.

The purpose of this app is to help with organizing and possibly providing some motivation to set up a calendar and routines. Making your calendar more public to people that you are close with may assist in keeping up with what you need to do. It puts a small social spin on making your calendar. Not only that, but it helps keep multiple collaborations in connection with your main calendar.

If time is available, the inclusion of fun social features may come to light, such as theming to ways that push you to want to interact with others' calendars.

# Read This Please

(Note: There were some parts that worked during the semester when we were testing, but failed when we implemented the secuirty and Nylas API. Such as the group stuff. I (Hamza) am telling you this just so you know that everything was working at some point, but it stopped working when it really mattered and now we just have to submit what we have for the sake of submitting something and getting a grade. We all pulled our weight in this project and while it didn't turn out exactly how we would have liked, I would still say we learned a lot (at least I did) and did good. I'm only sorry that we didn't have more to show for it. And despite the project not ending up to the vision that we originally had, we would all be grateful to recieve a passing grade for what we could accomplish. Thank you for all of your hard work and effort this semester, both professor and grader!)
